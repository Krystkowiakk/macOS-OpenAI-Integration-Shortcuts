# macOS-OpenAI-Integration-Shortcuts

macOS shortcuts using OpenAI's GPT for text tasks and translation to boost daily productivity. 
May be used as a base for your own everyday shortcuts and a great start to integrate your macOS with LLMs.

1. Download this repository to your macOS device.
2. Import each shortcut into the 'Shortcuts' app.
3. Enter your OpenAI API Key into the `GPT API Connector` shortcut's text field.

## Shortcuts Overview

- **GPT API Connector**: Essential for setting up the connection to the OpenAI API.
- **GPT - Correction Text**: Corrects highlighted text on your screen.
- **GPT - Answer Text**: Provides answers based on the context of a question in your clipboard and your highlighted sketch of the answer.
- **GPT - Translate Menu**: Translates highlighted text into a selected language.

## Usage

To use a shortcut, highlight text or copy it to your clipboard (depending on the shortcut), then run the shortcut using assigned keyboard shortcut. After a couple of seconds, the result will be ready to paste from your clipboard.

## Thanks
